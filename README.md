# Riviera DEV website

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging for production

The application can be compiled natively using:
```shell script
./mvnw -Dnative package
```

Now you can create a Debian package with:
```shell script
fakeroot ./debian/rules clean binary
```

And deploy the resulting Debian package on the production server.
